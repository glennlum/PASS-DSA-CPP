Pseudocode for SET Operations (from Lecture 19)

SUBSET
IsSubsetOf (other)
 Boolean subset = true
 WHILE more elements in this set AND
     more elements in the other set AND 
  subset = true
 IF this element = other element
 Get next element from each set
 ELSE IF this element < other element
 subset = false
 ELSE
 Get next element from other set
 ENDIF
 ENDWHILE
 IF more elements in this set
 subset = false
 ENDIF
END IsSubsetOf

UNION
Union (other, newSet) 
 WHILE more elements in this set AND
     more elements in the other set
 IF this element = other element
 Add this element into newSet
 Get next element from each set
 ELSE IF this element < other element
 Add this element to newSet
 Get next element from this set
 ELSE
 Add other element to newSet
 Get next element from other set
 ENDIF
 ENDWHILE
 WHILE more elements in this set
 Add this element to newSet
 Get next element from this set
 ENDWHILE
 WHILE more elements in other set
 Add other element to newSet
 Get next element from other set
 ENDWHILE
END Union

INTERSECTION
Intersection (other, newSet) 
 WHILE more elements in this set AND
     more elements in the other set
 IF this element = other element
 Add this element into newSet
 Get next element from each set
 ELSE IF this element < other element
 Get next element from this set
 ELSE
 Get next element from other set
 ENDIF
 ENDWHILE
END Intersecton

DIFFERENCE
Difference(other, newSet) 
 WHILE more elements in this set AND
     more elements in the other set
 IF this element = other element
 Get next element from each set
 ELSE IF this element < other element [2]
 Add this element to newSet
 Get next element from this set
 ELSE
 Get next element from other set
 ENDIF
 ENDWHILE
 WHILE more elements in this set
 Add this element to newSet
 Get next element from this container
 ENDWHILE
END Difference
