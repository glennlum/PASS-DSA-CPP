 
----A note on the given code----


Coding is only half the work. 

A complete piece of code must also comprise the following:

- Unit-testing, 
- debugging, 
- and commenting.

The container class provided is incomplete. 

Consider the following guidelines:

[1 - Testing] 
First, the members of the class have not been correctly named. You will need to run tests to find out what they actually do and rename them appropriately.

[2 - Debugging] 
Next, you will need to determine if each method is doing what it is meant to be doing and understand the limitations of the code. 

Of course, you may re-work the code as you please.

[3 - Commenting] 
Lastly, you will need to provide Doxygen style comments so that other programmers (including yourself) can understand what your code is designed to do. Comments ensure that your code retains its usefulness and maintainability over the long term.


Once done, you may import your container class to other programs for use.

Tip: When in doubt, it helps to discuss your code with others.
